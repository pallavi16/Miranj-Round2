<strong>Why Miranj?</strong>
   My inclination towards working at Miranj drives from the fact that what
they seek in a developer almost perfectly aligns with my current skills
and my future goals. It is true that <i>‘actions speak louder than words’</i>. So,
if you look at some of the github links attached above, you would find that most of
my work is relevant to the job description.  I see Miranj as a launchpad where I could
wear multiple hats (in both technical and non-technical aspect) alongside with focusing
on developing applications.
<br/><br/>
<strong>How would I add value to Miranj?</strong>
<ul>
<li>By writing clean code and building reusable web design and interfaces</li>
<li>By maintaining Git discipline: regularly pushing code on Git to ensure team validation and version control.</li>
<li>By working independently on modules and ensuring accountability for my own actions to be able to act with both urgency and integrity</li>
<li>Meeting deadlines in a timely manner to stay organised </li>
<li>Being great at communication skills, I would be able to interact with clients and users to understand and meet their application/design requirements. </li>
<li>Being passionate for technology and curious to explore new tools, I’d regularly update and discuss with the team in reassessing the use of most suitable tools to build next generation interfaces </li>
</ul>
<strong>How would my current job be different from the new one?</strong>
<ul>
<li>I currently work with a non-profit organization but Miranj,
being a startup would have a completely different setup.</li>
<li>My current organization has more than 50 engineers who are divided into different teams
based on the project requirements. Each engineer is given a specific module to work on in a huge project.
Miranj, on the other hand, is relatively smaller in size where
I believe there is a wide scope of handling multiple tasks at hand,
lots of work to do and code to write which would be challenging yet exciting.</li>
<li>My current job caters to the field of healthcare where the organization’s hierarchy is
such that the developers work and report to the managers and the team lead.
But by working at Miranj, I would be directly collaborating with the founders
as well as communicating with the users (or clients), thus
having a better chance to grow professionally .</li>
</ul>
<strong>Present work culture and comparison to Miranj? </strong>
<ul>
		<li> I am a little dubious about the work culture at Miranj as I've never had
    an exposure to work in India (not even remotely).
     But I’m sure that it would be pretty exciting and
      I would get a learn a lot from the incredibly talented people at Miranj.</li>
<li> Work culture in the United States is pretty good as everyone tries to collaborate
and meet deadlines and specifications of the project in a timely manner. However,
nothing could match being in your own country with your own people around.
Which is why I’m really looking forward to relocating soon and to get stuck
in traffic jams for hours everyday! Ha! </li>
