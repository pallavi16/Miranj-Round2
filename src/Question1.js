        <strong>Current Job?</strong> I am currently working as a software design engineer at <b> <a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/"> Huntsman Cancer Institute </a> </b>writing a web application ‘ART Admin’ using React. I recently finished the migration of a project called ‘Research Administrator’ (working with the frontend team) from AngularJS to Angular5.
        <br/>Web Stack and Tools Used: AngularJS, Angular 5, React, IntelliJ IDEA, Git etc. <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>Previous Job?</strong> Previously I worked as a software developer with a stealth startup called <b><a href="https://www.ebibelot.com/"> Ebibelot  </a></b>based in San Jose, CA. I was working there to build a musical application demo for kids on web and mobile platform using AR/VR and AI technology. The goal was to try and leverage AI technology in the educational space and build a platform to revolutionize the use of camera.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Education?</strong> I graduated with a Masters in Comp Engineering  from the <b><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/">University of Utah </a></b>with relevant coursework in Algorithms, Database Systems, Artificial Intelligence and Operating systems.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Internship?</strong> Worked as a Web Developer Intern with ‘Swisk’ in New York to develop web and mobile vehicle seeking application similar to Uber. My task was to implement customer and driver side RESTful APIs in Java.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Fun Projects?</strong> I believe that building projects is the best way to learn, not just the language but also learning to fix errors. So, I usually like to explore new technologies by building my own web applications. Some of the cool stuff can be found
        <b><a href="https://github.com/pallavi16?tab=repositories"> here: </a></b>

        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Why new job?</strong> Personal reason: Willing to relocate to India (close to family); <br/>Professional Reason:  find work that is more challenging than my current job. <br/> Currently, I’m looking for something that could put wheels on my career to learn and advance my skills as a developer.
        <br/><br/>
        <strong>Considerations for evaluating an opportunity or expectations from the new job?</strong>
        <ul >
        <li>A place where my work is not limited to web development. If need be, I could help and switch to full stack and learn something new in the process.</li>
        <li>A place where there is an opportunity to work in an agile environment with a possibility to collaborate with the rest of the team.</li>
        <li>A team whose goal is to conceptualize ideas to build next generation of pixel-perfect web interfaces/designs and create amazing user experiences.</li>
        <li>A work culture where each step/stage (Plan, Design, Build, Test, Launch) is given its own importance.</li>
        <li> A place where work-life balance is considered important.</li>
        <li>(Optional but not mandatory) Considering the long commute time in Delhi and to ensure time management, possibility of working remote sometimes.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Present compensation?</strong> 70,000 USD<br/>
        <strong>Future expected compensation? </strong>The range mentioned in the job description should be good to start with!
